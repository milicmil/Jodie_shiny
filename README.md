Interactive Shiny app for Jodie's RNN output



This is a simple interactive shiny app that visually showcases te efficacy of Jodie's RNN output. It does a comparison of the test data vs predicted data. The predicted data used the initial values to predict the change in the varables for the subsequent 17 periods. Period 1 is the initial data that was given to the trained algorithm. Note that categorical variables are always predicted as floats.
